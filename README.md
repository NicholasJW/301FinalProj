Structure design draft is presented in design.jpeg. Keep updating make file and all the header files until finishing all the structure set up.

#New Updates!! ( From Nick )#
I just had some git issue so I cleaned up the repository and recover everything. Here's where we at: FileReader, InstructionMem, Registers and DataMem fully inplemented and tested. Also, make file and main.cpp also finished and tested. All we have left is processor and its corresponding units, which isn't gonna cause any structural issue. I will keep working over the weekend.

Working on Processor right now.
